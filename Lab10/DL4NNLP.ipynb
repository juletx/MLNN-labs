    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab session is organized in two main parts. The first part is devoted to build a classifier for textual input. In the second part we will work with word embeddings to understand their usefulness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Sentiment Analysis (1h approx)\n",
    "\n",
    "In first part we will implement a series models for __sentence classification__ using Keras and TensorFlow. Given a sentence our model will predict if it is a positive or negative piece of texts. The dataset we are going to use ranges the polarity annotation from 0 to 5, where 0 denotes extremelt negative sentiment,  and 5  is the most  positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, for this lab we will simplify the task, and we will translate the 5-way classification task (actually [0-5] regression task) into 2-way classification task (0 $\\rightarrow$ _negative,_ ;1 $\\rightarrow$ positive),\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the main __objectives__ of this lab session for this part are the following: \n",
    "- How to represent text as input of neural network models (the _one-hot econding_).\n",
    "- Understant the mechanics of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (a.k.a Feedforward layer) with TensorFlow.\n",
    "- Learn how to build, train and evaluate suitable for text model in Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, once you finished the whole lab, you could explore following things:\n",
    "- Explore hyperparameters like:\n",
    "  - Optimizers: SGD, ADAGRAD, etc.\n",
    "  - Learning Rates\n",
    "  - Regularization (more on this next lab)\n",
    "- Plot learning curves for model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Word Embeddings (1h approx)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the session  we will learn how to work with word embeddings. We show that applying simple techniques we can implement very cool stuff. \n",
    "\n",
    "This part is divided in many parts that in most of the cases do not need code implementation. Hopefully, you would complete the assignment in a short time and have great fun too. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main __objective__ of this part is to learn about some interesting task that can be acomplish with word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Task 1__: Word similarity and relatedness\n",
    "- __Task 2__: Score semantically the words\n",
    "- __Task 3__: Do analogies, like _Man is to King like Woman is to Queen_\n",

    "Once data is loaded the next step is to preprocess it to obtain the vectorized form (i.e. the process of transforming text into numeric tensors), which basically consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization, tipically segment the text into words. (Alternatively, we could segment text into characters, or extract n-grams of words or characters.)\n",
    "- Definition of the dictionary index and vocabulary size (in this case we set to 1000 most frequent words)\n",
    "- Transform each word into a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "How much can we improve the current classifier? We can follow multiple strategies to improve the performance of our model: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase training size**: Usually this is the most effective way to improve the resuls, but it is the most costly at the same time. In our case we are using the whole dataset, so we can't exploit this estrategy (you can simulate by using smaller set of training as baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase vocabulary**: We are not using the whole vocabulary of the training set. Vocabulary pruning can be useful to avoid overfiting, but can affect generalization properties as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The use of correct neural archictecture**: We can increase the expresivity of the model by adding more parameters in different forms: 1) increasing number of hidden layers, 2) increasing the size of layers, 3) combining both. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The use of correct optimization strategy**: We can try more effective optimizers than SGD. For example, Adam optimizer is one of the most popular in NLP. In many cases correct learning rate value makes a difference. So exploring different learning rate values can be interesting choice to improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of epochs**: How long we traing is something we need too control as training to long can derive to overfit the model. On the contrary, if we train for a short time the model will hardly learn anything. There are different ways to select number of training epochs, but a common one is to inspect learning curves and select the point that has lower loss in development. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization weight, dropout, batch size, etc.**: Deep learning is full of hyperparameters and small *tricks* that are important to know. Each model in a particular task has its own optimum values which we don't know in advance. \n"

    "### 1D CNNs for texts (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture for texts are much like a 2D CNN that are tipically used in computer vision. Instead of having two dimension for applying convolutional filters, in this case, due to the sequential nature of the data, convolutions are applied along one axis (See image below). \n",
    "\n",
    "CNN based archictures for sentence classification have tipically the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Convolutional layer__: It uses convolutions that extracts local 1D patches (subsequences) from the input sentences. Recall that word indeces are first transformed to embedding space. This type of convolutions can recognize local patterns such as bigrams and trigrams.  As explained in class, convolution layers change the shape of the input sequence. Depending on the type of padding and stride the length of the output would be longer, same size, or shorter. The depending on the number of filters used the output depth would change as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If ```padding = 'same'```, then the spatial dimensions of the convolutional layer are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```output_length = ceil(input_length / stride)```\n",
    "\n",
    "  If ```padding = 'valid'```, then the spatial dimensions of the convolutional layer are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```output_length = ceil(input_length - kernel_size + 1) / stride)```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Max-pooling layer__: The main objective is to reduce drastically the output size of the convolution layers. 1D pooling operation is the same as the 2D. It takes 1D subsequences from convolutional output as input and return the maximum value. Similarly to convolutional layer, depending on the ```pool_size```, ```stride``` and ```padding``` we'd obtain different reduction of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Fully connected layer__: We can flatten the output of the max-pooling layer and feed to fully-connected layer to perform _positive_ vs _negative_ classification.\n",
