## Instructions

The practical sessions will be carried out using Python on its third version along with several of its libraries. We employ the jupyter notebook environment, as we find it very useful for understanding the code provided. All the required software is already available in the computers of the lab. However, in case a personal computer is used instead of the lab machines, either by choice of the student or because of the current situation, we provide some guidelines for installing the necessary software in personal computers.

### Python 3

If you are using any Linux distribution, you most likely already have Python 3 installed in your machine.
Computers running on Windows 10 don't have Python 3 installed by default. Several guides can be found over the internet, for example: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows. Same happens with MAC computers. Here, a link with a similar guide: https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac.

### Virtual Environment

The usage of Virtual Environments (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is strongly recommended by several Python developer communities. Both links provided for Mac and Windows include steps to install the virtual environment module. Several guides on how to install virtual environment for Linux are also available on the internet. For example: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-up-a-python-virtual-environment-on-debian-10-buster.

### Python 3 Libraries

We will use several libraries during the course. The list available in the "requirements.txt" file made available to you along with this one contains all of them (as well as some others that may be helpful in case you want to explore beyond the contents of the subject). They can be installed using the pip3 functionality (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).

### Jupyter Notebook

Perhaps, the most important library of the list is Jupyter, as all the content that we will provide during the course will be on Jupyter notebook format (https://jupyter.org/). So, make sure it is correctly installed and running. It is very simple to use, and we will make a short introduction of how it works in the first class.

### Google Colaboratory

Google offers the Google Colaboratory tool, which can be accessed via Google Drive. It consists of a jupyter notebook, remotely run at their servers. We don't guarantee that all of our notebooks will work using this tool, but some students have successfully followed the subject using it in past years. Again, several guides exist on the internet about the usage of this tool, one of which happens to be https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c. For importing the content provided in the subject, uploading the jupyter notebooks to Drive and opening them as Colaboratory document should be enough.
